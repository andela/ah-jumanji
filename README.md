## CSS Framework Research:
### SEMANTIC UI.
Modern front-end development framework, powered by LESS and jQuery. It has a sleek, subtle, and flat design look that provides a lightweight user experience
#### Advantages:
- Semantic solutions: Offers Semantic class names making it easy to learn.
- Reduced load time. Lets user load components of choice reducing load time in comparison to other css frameworks.

#### Disadvantages:
- Executing custom workaround can be challenging since it uses javascript customisation.
- The package's files are large(larger than bootstrap).

### Bootstrap.
HTML, CSS, Js based framework originally created by a developer and designer at twitter.
#### Advantages:
- Responsive. Styling adapts perfectly with almost all devices screens.
- Consistency. Works well with all browsers.
- Quick development and efficient. Easy to learn and customise. Each component is also configured to ensure good performance.

#### Disavantages:
- Package's Size of files too large.
- Could lead to messy work  due to dependency on css classes.

### Materialize.
Materialize is a CSS framework based on Google's Material Design
#### Advantages:
- Speeds up development. It offers default stylings,
- UX-focused(specifically for mobile web applications). Has components that provide more feedback to users.
- Easy to use. Has detailed documentation and code examples.
- Light file size.

#### Disadvantages:
- Little support for materialize.
- Opinionated making it harder to customise.
- Poor GRID system



#### Note:
Semantic classes - Semantic Class names explain why the class is used and what it is. They don't explain it's behaviour.
